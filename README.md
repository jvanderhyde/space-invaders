# space-invaders
Space invaders with different character classes. Database-driven leaderboard.

This project is based on a simple Space Invaders clone, with the addition of multiple character archetypes (fighter, rogue, wizard).

High scores are stored in a database. Updating and accessing the high score data are an in-class assignment.
